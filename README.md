Categorical Columns:

CCA3 (three-letter country code), Country/Territory, Capital, Continent.
These are textual fields and can be used for classification or grouping.
Example use: Group countries by continent to analyze regional population trends.
Numerical Columns:

Historical population data (2022 Population, 2020 Population, ..., 1970 Population): Ideal for time-series analysis and trend prediction.
Area (km²): Land area can help in calculating and verifying density.
Density (per km²): Population per unit area. Correlation with other features can show overpopulation or underpopulation trends.
Growth Rate: Predict future population sizes.
World Population Percentage: Analyze contributions of countries to global population.
Ranking Columns:

Rank: Numeric representation of order by population or other criteria.
Potential Learning Types
Supervised Learning:

Regression:
Predict the 2022 Population using historical population data, growth rates, and land area.
Predict Growth Rate based on historical populations and density.
Classification:
Classify countries into population size categories (e.g., small, medium, large).
Unsupervised Learning:

Clustering:
Cluster countries based on population size, growth rate, and density to identify regions with similar characteristics.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Use methods like PCA to reduce redundancy in features like historical populations.
Time-Series Analysis:

Predict population trends over time using historical data columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze correlations between variables (e.g., density and growth rate).
Understand historical growth patterns by continent or region.
